This project contains a minimalist USB board for STM32F042F6P6. It has PA0-PA7
pins broken out and a LED connected to PA14, and can serve as a highly compact
development board.

My version of the board uses a LP5907 LDO. Other LDOs in SOT23-5 packages
should also work, but you may need to cut the "bypass" pin of your LDO. (LP5907
does not have a bypass pin, so it is grounded.)

The project also contains a blinky example, which may be used as a foundation
for other projects. To build, simply type "make", or read the header of the
Makefile for details. To flash, connect BOOT0 ("BT0") to 3.3V ("3V3") on the
board, plug the board into a USB slot, then type "make flash". Depending system
configuration, you may need to use sudo. See

  http://www.libopencm3.org/wiki/USB_DFU

for details. Having a udev rule in place is highly recommended so you do not
have to run make with root privilege.
